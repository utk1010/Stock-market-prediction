Stock Market Prediction Using Deep Learning Techniques
This repository contains code for predicting future stock market prices using various deep learning techniques, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Stacked LSTM, GRU, LSTM-GRU, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore different deep learning models for predicting stock market prices. By leveraging the power of RNN-based architectures and GANs, we aim to improve the accuracy and robustness of stock price predictions.
