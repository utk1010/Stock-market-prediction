This repository contains code for predicting future stock market prices using various deep learning techniques, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Stacked LSTM, GRU, LSTM-GRU, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).
The goal of this project is to explore different deep learning models for predicting stock market prices. By leveraging the power of RNN-based architectures and GANs, we aim to improve the accuracy and robustness of stock price predictions.
